<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></h2>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(A) Informal Dispute Resolution</span></strong></p>
<p>Company’s customer service team can address the majority of any concerns or disputes you may have about your use of the Services. Please contact us by email, phone or in writing at the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://myqrcode.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef9c9a9f9f809d9baf82969e9d8c808b8ac18c8082"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="becdcbceced1cccafed3c7cfccddd1dadb90ddd1d3">[email&#160;protected]</span></a><br>+1-631-892-9925</p>
<p>If customer service is unable to resolve any concern or dispute (collectively, “Claim”), you agree to first try to resolve the Claim informally and in good faith by providing written Notice of Claim to the address below:</p>
<p>Address: 46, Akademik Stefan Mladenov Str., Office 5, 1700 Sofia, Bulgaria</p>
<p>The Notice of Claim must provide Company with reasonable notice of your identity, a description of the nature and basis of your Claim, and the relief you are seeking, including the specific amount of any monetary relief you are seeking on an individual basis.</p>
<p>If your Claim is not resolved within 60 days of receipt, any resulting legal actions must be resolved through binding arbitration. including any dispute about whether arbitration is required for the dispute, subject to the exceptions set forth below. Neither party shall initiate legal action until 60 days after the Notice of Claim is received.</p>
<p>This section governs any dispute between you and us, and how that dispute will be legally resolved if necessary. Remember, these dispute resolution provisions only apply to disputes between Company and you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(B) <u>Governing Law and Location</u></span></strong></p>
<p>This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles, provided that the arbitration provision shall be governed by the United States of America Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(C) </span><u>Arbitration</u></strong></p>
<p>Any Claim, including, but not limited to, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, including the formation, interpretation, breach or termination thereof, including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable, will be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal will consist of one arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on the sole arbitrator within 14 days of commencement of the arbitration, than JAMS shall designate the sole arbitrator.</p>
<p>The place of arbitration will be New York, US. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>Please note that, depending on your country of residence, under certain circumstances you may be able to bring a dispute before the appropriate authorities or courts in the country in which you reside.</p>
<p>For US Residents, any disputes under these Terms will be resolved on an individual basis through binding arbitration, with no class relief.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlines for Completion of Arbitration and Interim Phases:</strong></p>
<p>The following time limits are to apply to any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery is to be completed within 90 days of the service of the arbitration demand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The evidentiary hearing on the merits (“Hearing”) is to commence within 120 days of the service of the arbitration demand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the Hearing, each side is to be allotted 2 days for presentation of direct evidence and for cross examination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A brief, reasoned award is to be rendered within 45 days of the close of the Hearing or within 45 days of service of post-hearing briefs if the arbitrator(s) direct the service of such briefs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The arbitrator must agree to the foregoing deadlines before accepting appointment. Failure to meet any of the foregoing deadlines will not render the award invalid, unenforceable or subject to being vacated. The arbitrator, however, may impose appropriate sanctions and draw appropriate adverse inferences against the party primarily responsible for the failure to meet any such deadlines.</p>
<p>By agreeing to arbitration, each party waives its right to sue in court or to have a jury trial.</p>
<p>The language of the arbitration shall be in English.</p>
<p>The United States of America Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p>The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the Hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p><strong><u>(D) No Class Actions</u></strong></p>
<p>You and Company agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis in arbitration. You agree that any arbitration or other legal action shall be limited to the two of us as parties, and any joinder of other parties is not allowed. This means that you cannot participate in any sort of representative proceeding against Company, including, but not limited to, as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action. if any portion of this class action waiver is deemed unenforceable or invalid as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court.</p>
<p><strong><u>(E) Court Action to Assist Arbitration</u></strong></p>
<p>Even though we are agreeing to arbitration, you and Company are both allowed to seek relief from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction in aid of arbitration. For example, a court proceeding would be allowed to stay a court action, compel arbitration, confirm an arbitration award, or seek injunctive relief whether temporary or permanent.</p>

<p><strong><u>(A) Payment of Fees</u></strong></p>
<p>We have free (up to 20 scans per QR code) and paid Services. You may be required to purchase or pay a fee to access some of our Services. You agree to pay Company all fees (“Fees”) associated with your use of the Services, as indicated to you at the time you agree to such Fees (such as through the Subscription, as defined hereunder, and during the checkout process). You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made. You further agree to promptly update account and payment information, including email address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed. We bill you through an online billing account for purchases made via MyQRCode.com. Plans and prices may be charged in US dollars or in local currencies so exact charges may vary based on your location.</p>
<p>You agree to pay all charges or fees at the prices then in effect for your purchases, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon making your purchase. If your purchase is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until you notify us of your cancellation.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we have already requested or received payment. We also reserve the right to refuse any order placed through the Services.</p>

In other words, your Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled in advance of the next payment period by you. Please pay attention to the Fees and Subscription Terms disclosed to you during the order process for your Subscription.
